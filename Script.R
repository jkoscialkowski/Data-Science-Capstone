## easy given matrices 
    
## in bookmarks: the guy repo gives good pipeline of creating the model from ngrams ++++ UNKING is there as well

## combining models with and without stopwords

## data split: 55-15-15-15
## compare n in ngrams by cv in the building set, decide on smoothing on first 15, decide on boosting on second 15,
## validation on the last 15
